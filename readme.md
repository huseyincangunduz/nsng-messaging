  - [ ] User Message

  The id of the user message will be: username, device id (probably uuid or mac address), date, hour, minute and millisecond.

  - [ ] User status

  It works by sending back the id of the message as soon as it is displayed or the last received message and can indicate that the message was received successfully

  - [ ] User

  There will be no central server. So name, photo and device id(probably uuid or mac address) are required

- [ ] Communication (TCP or Similar)
